Bio:

Welcome to my space, and thank you for taking the time to be here! I'm a second-year student at UC
Berkeley with a strong interest in discrete mathematics, and all forms of market performance predictors.
    <Smaller/side bio: I used fail my math tests. Check out my blog to read about how I got here.>

I like to teach, and I'm currently enjoying positions as a junior mentor and backend developer for UC Berkeley's largest student-run tutoring organization. <include link to CSM here>
I'm also a uGSI for UC Berkeley's Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory course <include link to
CS70>. You can find more information about my teaching portfolio here.

I'm currently spending a lot of my time <include club info and mission> OR <include research info and mission>.

This page is meant to act as a catch-all portfolio for projects I am working on, my sources of inspiration, and
a place to post my thoughts and reactions. I hope you find something thought provoking in your time here.
